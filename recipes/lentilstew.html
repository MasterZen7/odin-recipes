        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lentil soup is a soup with lentils as its main ingredient; it may be vegetarian or include meat, and may use brown, red, yellow, green or black lentils, with or without the husk. </p>
        <p>Dehulled yellow and red lentils disintegrate in cooking, making a thick soup.</p>
